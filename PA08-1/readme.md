# Print / Delete Linked List

**1. code implementation**
- **printList()**
  - print the elements in a linked list.
  - print like the below. there is a space between numbers. and after the last number, there is a space.  
  ```42 -3 17```
- **deleteList()**
  - delete all elements in a linked list
  - It is implemented in the form of deleting nodes while traversing the linked list.
  - “delete” is automatically output whenever you delete each node.

**2. Understand the main function**
we use Dynamic allocation to make linked list instead of class's constructor in main function.  
Please **understand the algorithm** for creating a linked list of the main function.
