**Standard input and output**

In this assignment, students practice how to use standard (std) input function *cin*. Compared to std input function in C, *scanf*, you don’t need to datatypes of variables because the syntax doesn’t need them.

Suppose you would like to get inputs from the screen for two variables.  
The syntax of function cin is like the following.
```c++
cin >> variable_name_1 >> variable_name_2;
```

Note that the direction of arrows (>>) is right. Remember the direction of arrows (<<) is left when using *cout*.

Please develop the program that gets two values, parses two values into two variables *a* and *b* then print them. Your screen should be the following below. Note that we type a value for integer variable *a* then a value for floating variable *b*.
```
110 11.1
110 11.1
```
