# Protected access modifier

We have two classes: UnivMem (parent class) and Student (child class).  
At this time, modify a constructor of Student without member initializer.  
Please modify an access modifier of class UnivMem and initialize inherited attributes directly in the child constructor.  
Please print attributes of Student class like below:
```
student: ID AGE GPA
```

For example,
```
student: 20241111 20 4.3
```
