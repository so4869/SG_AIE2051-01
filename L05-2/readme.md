# Private accessor

In class datatype, there are keywords that control the access of members (data or function), called accessors. Accessor public makes members accessible in all functions. Accessor private only allows access to members within the class.

When you compile the initial code, it isnâ€™t successfully compiled due to the access of private members from main function. Your task is to implement two member functions in class Rectangle.

 - void init(int width, int height): set member variables width and height to values of arguments.
 - int getArea(): compute and return the area of the rectangle

Please modify two codes, main.cpp and rectangle.cpp, to work correctly.
