### Prime test

1\) Implement the function **bool IsPrime(int)** to determine whether the entered integer n is a prime number, and 2) print whether n is prime.

**[Definition of a prime number]**  
A prime number is bigger than 1 and has only 1 and itself as divisors.

Case 1. If n is a prime number, print as follows:  
```{n} is prime.```

Case 2. If n is not a prime number, print as follows:  
```{n} is not prime.```
