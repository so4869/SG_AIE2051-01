# Class Array

Your task is to implement class Array. Class Array has two member variables: integer variable length and integer array array. Class Array should contain the arrray data but not a pointer.

Class Array supports the following three member functions including the constructor.

 - Constructor(int length, int array[]): set member variables and copy the array data into the member array.
 - getLength(): return the length of the array
 - print(): print the array information. The print format should be the below.

```
LENGTH elements: arr[0] arr[1] arr[2] ... arr[LENGTH-1]
```
Note that arr[i] and LENGTH are values in the corresponding variables.

Please declare class Array in header file “array.h” and define member functions in array.cpp.
