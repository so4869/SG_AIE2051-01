### Switch-Case Example

Implement a program using a switch statement that takes an integer num as input and prints a description according to the following condition:

- When num is between 3 and 5  
```num : 3 or 4 or 5```
- When num is between 6 and 8  
```num : 6 or 7 or 8```
- else  
```undefined```
