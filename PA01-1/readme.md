**Variable Initialization and variable output**

In this task, the program prints values of variables. There are three types of variables: integer variable a, floating variable b, and character variable c. Your task is to initlaize each of them correctly and print them on the command window.

To initlaize variable v with value b,
```
v=b;
```

Note that operator = is not a equal operator anymore in the most programming language. It is an **ASSIGNMENT** operator. Instead, the equal operator in C++ is ==.

Your command window should look like the following.
```
a is 2024
b is 3.14159
c is S
```
