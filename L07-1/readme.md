# Function Overriding

In this task, we will practice function overriding by reimplementing function `print`.  
There are three classes: one base class (parent) UnivMem and two derived classes (childs) Student and Professor.  
**First, inherit the base class to the derived classes.**  
Then, **implement function** `print` **of each derived class.**  
For Student class, function print should print out class information in the following format:
```
Student - id: ID age: AGE gpa: GPA
```
where ID, AGE and GPA are values of an instance.  
For Professor class, function print should print out class information in the following format:
```
Professor - id: ID age: AGE room: ROOM
```
where ID, AGE and GPA are values of an instance.

If you finish all of the task, please read the code in `main()` and see how the program works about UnivMem pointer.
