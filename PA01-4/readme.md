**Elementary arithmetic functions**  
The objective of this assignment is to implement five functions that compute elementrary arithmetic operations *in math.cpp*. The compiler will automatically detect where functions are defined (math.cpp) and functions are called/used (main.cpp) and link them through the compilation process. Your task is to define functions below in *math.cpp* :
 - int add (int a, int b)
 - int subtract (int a, int b)
 - int multiply (int a, int b)
 - int divide (int a, int b)
 - int modulo (int a, int b)

The return type of every functions is integer and parameter a is always the left operand (피연산자).

You don't need to include the math.hpp.

\<example\>  
input :
```
10 5
```
output :
```
a+b = 15
a-b = 5
a*b = 50
a/b = 2
a modulo b = 0
```
