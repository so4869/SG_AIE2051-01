# counting n-substrings

Tom, who likes pattern analysis, is interested in strings. One day, he starts to wonder how many substrings of a certain length appear in a string. Tom starts looking at the number of n-substrings and the number of each one's appearances in a complicated string. Let's help make this task easier for Tom by using **a map container** to store each substring and count its number of appearances

**Input**  
The length of the substrings (integer) and the string itself is entered.
```
2
abckababc
```

**Output**
```
ab 3
ba 1
bc 2
ck 1
ka 1
```
