# Array Insertion

Array insertion is an important concept in programming. It involves adding a new element to an existing array at a specific position. Let's break down this process and understand it step by step.

Imagine you have a bookshelf with books arranged in a specific order. Now, you want to add a new book in the middle of the shelf. What would you do?

1. You'd make space for the new book by moving the other books.
2. Then, you'd place the new book in the empty spot you created.

This is exactly what happens in array insertion.

You are tasked with creating a C++ program that performs array insertion based on user input. Your program should allow a user to create an initial array, then insert a new element at a specified position in that array. Please implement function insertElement and printArray correctly.


**Input & Output Example**
```
5               // the size of array
10 20 30 40 50  // elements
25 2            // put item 25 at index 2
```

```
10 20 30 40 50
Array after insertion: 10 20 25 30 40 50
```
