# Boolean

In C++, the bool data type represents a boolean value which can have one of two possible values: true or false.

This data type is primarily used for conditions and flags. The size of the bool type is implementation-specific, but itâ€™s guaranteed to be large enough to store the values 0 (for false) and 1 (for true).
